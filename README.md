QMuParser
=========
QMuParser is a fork of library [muparser](muparser.beltoforion.de) for project 
[Valentina](https://bitbucket.org/dismine/valentina).

Main reason for creation fork was have better math parser with support functions, localization and variables. 
Valentina based on Qt 5 and we did not find good math parser that based on Qt containers, so we decided port 
original muparser to Qt.
